# Project_5: Earthquake_Data_Analysis_for_Mediterranean_Region using PySpark

This project delves into the seismic history of the Mediterranean Region over the past 50 years, utilizing USGS Earthquake Catalog data. Employing K-means clustering, the analysis aims to elucidate event distribution and geological disparities across regions. Initially targeting Turkey and subsequently expanding to encompass the Mediterranean Sea area, the study seeks to uncover parallels among earthquake-prone locales like Italy and Greece. By scrutinizing earthquake types, regional similarities, and temporal trends, the project strives to illuminate distinct seismic patterns and potential future geological shifts.This endeavor promises fresh insights into earthquake causality and regional behavior, potentially guiding future seismic predictions.
