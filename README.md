In this project, the focus revolves around addressing two pivotal research questions: "How effective are classification models in predicting churn for an Iranian dataset?" and "What key factors contribute significantly to churn within the company?"

The primary objective entails the creation and selection of a robust classification model, with a comparative analysis spanning Logistic Regression, Lasso Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Classification Tree. By doing so, the project aims to unveil the varying effectiveness of these models when predicting churn within the provided dataset.

To ensure a comprehensive assessment, the researcher employs a range of evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix, accuracy, F1 score, AUC, and ROC curve. The culmination of this analysis leads to the identification of the optimal classification model for the task.

Beyond model selection, the project delves into the realm of exploratory and clustering analysis. This pursuit seeks to comprehend the distinct characteristics of segmented customers and sheds light on clusters more prone to churn. By discerning these patterns, the project gains insight into the attributes that significantly influence churn rates.

Ultimately, this venture holds the potential to uncover the driving forces behind customer decisions to switch providers. Through a combination of advanced modeling and exploratory insights, the project contributes valuable knowledge that can guide strategic decisions aimed at customer retention and satisfaction.
